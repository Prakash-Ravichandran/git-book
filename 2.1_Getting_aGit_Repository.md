## Getting a Git Repository

You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:

> * You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or

> * You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.

1. Git clone command

2. Git clone command for target directory
