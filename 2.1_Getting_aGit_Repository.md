## Getting a Git Repository

You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:

> * You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or
>
> * You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.

1. Git clone command

2. Git clone command for target directory


## Learnings - * To add multiple files of same format like - .txt, .md, .java, .cpp, .json

> * ` git add *. <file format>`

## Cloning an Existing Repository

> * `git clone <url>`
> * `$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2`

That creates a directory named libgit2, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new libgit2 directory that was just created, youâ€™ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used
